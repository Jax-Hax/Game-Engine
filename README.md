# Simple Game Engine written in Rust with wgpu
This is the engine I am using for my graphics programs, like an upcoming machine learning visualization tool I am working on making. If you want to see how to make your own, check out [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/), and then you can look at my blog post here to turn it into an abstract engine that you can reuse.
